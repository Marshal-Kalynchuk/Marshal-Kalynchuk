+ Database Management: Competent with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and AWS DynamoDB.

### Current Projects

üìö Book Subscription Platform (Private Repository): This project is a testament to my ability to blend various technologies to create a comprehensive solution. Leveraging Ruby on Rails for robust backend functionality, Flutter for a seamless and responsive frontend experience, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for efficient and scalable cloud services, this book subscription platform represents the culmination of my skills in full-stack development. While the specifics of the project are private, the technology stack used underscores my focus on creating versatile and user-centric digital solutions.

üìù Last Will Creation Platform (Private Repository): This project is where I honed my web development skills, particularly in Ruby on Rails. It's a platform designed for creating and managing last wills, utilizing a robust tech stack including Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though it's not intended for launch, this project is pivotal in my journey as it significantly deepened my understanding of web technologies and back-end development. It remains private as it represents a substantial investment of time and learning.

ü§ñ Custom C++ Neural Network Project: In this project, I developed a neural network entirely from scratch using C++. It was not only an exploration into the mathematics of simple neural networks but also a deep dive into C++'s capabilities, especially in areas like arrays and memory management. The hands-on experience with these core concepts significantly enhanced my understanding of both neural network operations and the intricacies of C++ programming. This project stands as a testament to my technical proficiency and my ability to grasp complex computational concepts.
